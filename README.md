# SilentSignal - Noiseless Vehicle Horn System

## Overview
SilentSignal is an innovative project designed to reduce vehicle noise pollution by internalizing vehicle communication and selective signaling. This system uses wireless communication between vehicles and IR sensors to reduce honking frequency, improving both road safety and public health.

## Features
- **Internalized Communication**: Enables vehicles to communicate without honking loudly.
- **Selective Signaling**: Reduces honking frequency while ensuring safety.
- **Health & Safety**: Minimizes the negative impact of noise pollution on health.

## Components
- Arduino Mega 2560 R3
- 16X2 Serial LCD Modules
- NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver Modules
- IR Sensors
- Audio Modules
- And more...

## Budget
Total Estimated Budget: BDT 8000
