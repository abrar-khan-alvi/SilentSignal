# SilentSignal - Noiseless Vehicle Horn System

**SilentSignal** is an innovative solution to reduce traffic noise pollution by replacing traditional honking with a wireless communication system between vehicles. This project uses **Arduino** and **NRF24L01** modules to enable vehicle-to-vehicle communication for selective signaling and honking.

## Features
- Wireless communication between vehicles to send/receive honking signals.
- Reduces the frequency of honking, thus improving public health.
- Components used: **Arduino**, **NRF24L01 Wireless Modules**, **IR Sensors**, and **LCD Modules**.

## Installation Guide
1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Arduino Mega/UNO/NANO
   - NRF24L01 Wireless Transceiver Modules
   - 16x2 LCD Modules
   - IR Sensors
   - Audio driver module (optional for sound)

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Download and install Arduino IDE: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
   - Install the **RF24** library via the Arduino IDE's library manager.

3. **Wiring Setup**:
   - Connect **NRF24L01** to your Arduino according to the wiring guide.
   - Connect **LCD modules** and **IR sensors** as per the circuit diagram.

4. Upload the **Transmitter Code** to the transmitting vehicle's Arduino and the **Receiver Code** to the receiving vehicle's Arduino.

## Usage Instructions
Once the system is set up and running, the transmitter sends honking signals while the receiver listens and responds accordingly.

## License
This project is open-source under the **MIT License**.
